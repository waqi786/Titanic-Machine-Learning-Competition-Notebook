# Titanic Machine Learning Competition Notebook

**Overview:**

This notebook provides a comprehensive approach to solving the Titanic Machine Learning competition on Kaggle. It includes data exploration, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation strategies to predict passenger survival. The goal is to utilize machine learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in predicting survival outcomes based on historical data.


**Key Features:**

1. Data Exploration: Initial examination and visualization of the Titanic dataset to understand patterns and relationships.
2. Feature Engineering: Creation and transformation of features to improve model performance.
3. Model Building: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms to predict survival, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
4. Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
